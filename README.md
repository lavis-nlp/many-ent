# ManyEnt: A Dataset for Few-shot Entity Typing

<i>We introduce ManyEnt, a benchmark for entity typing models in few-shot scenarios. ManyEnt offers a rich typeset, with a fine-grain variant featuring 256 entity types and a coarse-grain one with 53 entity types. Both versions have been derived from the Wikidata knowledge graph in a semi-automatic fashion.</i>
